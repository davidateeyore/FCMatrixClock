# FCMatrixClock

[from GerbClock readme]
the shed unit has changed to a 4 x FC8x8 LEDmatrix display design, I just have to clean up the code and assemble the clock in a 3D printed case..

using Fried Circuits 8x8 LED matrix PCBs in a simple Arduino + RTC module clock for the shed!
The box is done! 3D print in PLA+ on an Ender 5 pro..
The modules are loosely hanging together, but will move to a veroboard "motherboard", Power: Just USB or whack in a LiPo cell and charge as needed???
